** Sets

*** Set Notation
\begin{equation}
\large
N=\{0, 1, 2 \ldots\}
\end{equation}


*** Inductive specification
**** Recursive definition of sets
**** Definition 1.1.1 : Top-down Definition

A natural number, n, is in S if and only if:

\begin{equation}
\\
\large
n = 0,\hspace{3pt} or
\\
\large
n - 3 \in Û†Å≥S
\\
\end{equation}


**** Definition 1.1.2 : Bottom-up Definition
S is defined to be the smallest set contained in N satisfying

\begin{equation}
\\
\large
0 \in S
\\
\large
if\hspace{3pt} n \in S,\hspace{6pt} then\hspace{3pt} n + 3 \in S
\\
\end{equation}


**** Rules of Inference Version
\begin{equation}
\large
\frac{}{0 \in S}
\\[2em]
\large
\frac{n \in S}{n + 3 \in S}
\end{equation}


** Context-Free Grammars
A grammar is context-free if the rules describing its syntax are sufficient to
produce a valid instance. If other constraints (invariants) are required for
correctness, we call it a context-sensitive grammar. For example, a binary
search tree grammar is context sensitive, because the rules tell you only how to
construct syntactic elements, they do not tell you that all left nodes must be
less than right nodes. This extra invariant makes it context-sensitive.

* Exercises

** Exercise 1.1.3

Apparently this boils down to the bottom-up style not implicitly enforcing "if
and only if" in its rules for set inclusion. Interestingly, the top-down version
(1.1.1 above) explicitly included this language in its definition. Also
remarkable is the fact that rules of inference
